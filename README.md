## Staff Schedule App Frontend ##

* This is a react scheduler application given to me as an assignment for a job application. 
* It is implemented using React and is designed to communicate with a backend API to fetch cook and waiter scheduling data

**Installation Instructions:**

* Install NodeJS on your computer (so that you have access to npm)
* Run npm install

**Status (Things not working/incomplete):**
* The application is currently using data from hard-coded constants since the backend API is not working yet
* The code to fetch the data from the backend JSON API is commented out until the problem with the API is fixed
* The code to fetch the data from the backend API has not been tested to know if it is working correctly yet
